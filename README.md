# Finite_Volume_method (2021)
## Introduction
Welcome to the Finite Volume Method (FVM) project for MATLAB! This README provides an overview of the project, instructions for getting started, details about its usage for solving the 1D and 2D Laplace equations, the heat equation, and the Stokes equation, features, and how to contribute.
## Project Overview
The Finite Volume Method (FVM) is a numerical technique used to approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). 
This project focuses on implementing FVM solvers for four important equations:

1. **1D Laplace Equation**: Describes steady-state heat conduction along a one-dimensional domain.
2. **2D Laplace Equation**: Models steady-state heat conduction or potential fields in a two-dimensional region.
3. **Heat Equation**: Describes transient heat conduction in one or two dimensions.
4. **Stokes Equation**: Models the flow of incompressible viscous fluids.

This project aims to provide MATLAB-based FVM solvers for these equations, making it accessible for engineers, scientists, and researchers in various fields, including heat transfer, fluid dynamics, and electromagnetics.
